# Cryptography
Nowadays, digital communication has made noticeable development in many applications on the internet. so, the security of the data should also be provided across the globe that is using the data in the network. cryptography and steganography are two main techniques that can be used to provide network security. The aim of this project is to develop a new approach to hiding the secret information in the image, by combining steganography and cryptography. Here we discuss RSA encryption-decryption method and also using the stego-object how can simply cover the data behind it.
